#quote(attribution: [Paul Taylor #linebreak() #emph[Text-to-Speech Synthesis], 2009 @taylor_tts_2009], [Speech synthesis has progressed remarkably in recent years, and it is no longer the case
that state-of-the-art systems sound overtly mechanical and robotic. That said, it is normally fairly
easy to tell that it is a computer talking rather than a human, and so substantial progress is still to
be made.])

Substatial progress has been made in #abbr.a[TTS] -- it is often impossible to tell if a computer or human is talking.
